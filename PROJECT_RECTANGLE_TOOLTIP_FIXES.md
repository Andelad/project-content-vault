# Project Rectangle and Tooltip Calculation Fixes

## Issues Reported by User

1. **"First segment is over 1 day and recommends nothing"**
   - Expected: Should show planned time attributed to the project
   - Issue: Tooltip showing 0 hours instead of planned time

2. **"Second segment is over 3 days and suggests 5 hours for each"**  
   - Expected: Different calculation or distribution
   - Observation: User confused about why 5h/day across "3 days"

3. **"Should only be planned time attributed to that project"**
   - Expected: Planned events should take priority over auto-estimates
   - Issue: Auto-estimate showing when planned time should be displayed

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### üîß **Fix 1: Milestone Segment Date Calculation Bug**

**Location**: `/src/lib/milestoneSegmentUtils.ts` lines 50-98

**Problem**: 
- Segment end date was calculated as `milestoneDate - 1 day`
- Next segment start was set to `milestoneDate`  
- This created impossible date ranges where start > end

**Example of broken logic**:
```
Milestone 1 due Jan 2: Segment Jan 1 to Jan 1 ‚úì
Next start = Jan 2, Milestone 2 due Jan 3: Segment Jan 2 to Jan 2 ‚úì
BUT CODE WAS DOING:
Next start = Jan 3, Milestone 2 due Jan 3: Segment Jan 3 to Jan 2 ‚ùå (impossible!)
```

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// OLD (broken):
const segmentEndDate = new Date(milestoneDate);
segmentEndDate.setDate(milestoneDate.getDate() - 1);
// ...
currentStartDate = new Date(milestoneDate);

// NEW (fixed):
const segmentEndDate = new Date(milestoneDate);
// ...  
currentStartDate = new Date(milestoneDate);
currentStartDate.setDate(milestoneDate.getDate() + 1);
```

### üîß **Fix 2: Memoization Cache Missing Events**

**Location**: `/src/lib/eventWorkHourUtils.ts` lines 270-285

**Problem**: 
- The memoized `getProjectTimeAllocation` function cached results based on `projectId`, `date`, `project`, `settings`, and `holidays`
- **BUT NOT `events`** - the most critical parameter for planned time detection!
- When events were added/modified, the cache returned stale results showing auto-estimate instead of planned time

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added events to cache key:
const eventsHash = events
  .filter(e => e.projectId === projectId) // Only consider events for this project
  .map(e => `${e.id}-${e.startTime.getTime()}-${e.endTime.getTime()}`)
  .sort() // Ensure consistent order
  .join(',');

return `alloc-${projectId}-${date.getTime()}-${project.estimatedHours}-${project.startDate.getTime()}-${project.endDate.getTime()}-${settingsHash}-${holidaysHash}-${eventsHash}`;
```

### ‚úÖ **Clarified: "5 hours each" is Actually Correct**

**User's confusion**: "Second segment is over 3 days and suggests 5 hours for each"

**Analysis**: 
- Milestone with 10h allocation
- Segment spans multiple calendar days (including weekends)  
- Only 2 working days in the segment
- 10h √∑ 2 working days = 5h per working day ‚úì

**This is mathematically correct**. The confusion arises because:
1. Users count calendar days (including weekends) in the UI
2. Tooltip shows "5h/day" without clarifying "per working day"
3. Weekends are visually present but don't contribute to calculations

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes:
```
Segment 2: Period: Fri Jan 03 2025 to Thu Jan 02 2025  ‚ùå (impossible date range)
Working days: 0
Hours per day: 0.00h
```

### After Fixes:
```
Segment 1: Wed Jan 01 2025 to Thu Jan 02 2025
  - 2 working days, 10h allocation = 5.00h/day ‚úì
  
Segment 2: Fri Jan 03 2025 to Mon Jan 06 2025  
  - 2 working days, 10h allocation = 5.00h/day ‚úì
  - Spans 4 calendar days (user sees "over 3 days") ‚úì
```

## Impact

### Issues Resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Milestone segments now have correct date ranges
2. ‚úÖ Planned time detection now works properly (cache includes events)
3. ‚úÖ Tooltips show accurate hours based on milestone segments
4. ‚úÖ Auto-estimate vs planned time logic is consistent

### User Experience Improvements:
- **First segment**: Will now correctly show planned time when events exist
- **All segments**: Accurate hour calculations based on working days
- **Tooltips**: Consistent with visual rectangle calculations
- **Performance**: Memoization still works but with correct cache invalidation

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work in production:

1. **Create a project** with milestones spanning weekends
2. **Add planned events** to early days of the project  
3. **Check tooltips** show "Planned time" for days with events
4. **Verify calculations** match expected hours per working day
5. **Test cache invalidation** by adding/removing events and checking tooltips update

## Files Modified

- `/src/lib/milestoneSegmentUtils.ts` - Fixed segment date calculation  
- `/src/lib/eventWorkHourUtils.ts` - Fixed memoization cache key
