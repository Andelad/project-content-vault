Hi Lovable,

I need your help implementing the timeline architecture refactor. The database migration is complete and I have detailed implementation instructions ready.

**Please read these files in order:**

1. **`LOVABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** ‚≠ê (START HERE - complete implementation guide)
2. **`IMPLEMENTATION_READY.md`** (phase-by-phase overview)
3. **`TIMELINE_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR.md`** (architecture context)

**What I need you to implement:**

**Phases 1-6** as documented in `LOVABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:

1. **Phase 1:** Update type definitions in `src/types/core.ts`
   - Update `Milestone` interface (add new fields)
   - Add `RecurringConfig` interface
   - Add `DayEstimate` interface

2. **Phase 2:** Create `src/services/calculations/dayEstimateCalculations.ts`
   - Main function: `calculateProjectDayEstimates()`
   - This becomes the single source of truth for timeline rectangles

3. **Phase 3:** Create `src/services/unified/UnifiedDayEstimateService.ts`
   - Wrap calculations with business logic
   - Add validation methods

4. **Phase 4:** Create `src/services/orchestrators/TimelineOrchestrator.ts`
   - One method: `getTimelineData()`
   - Both Days and Weeks views will call this

5. **Phase 5:** Update `src/services/repositories/MilestoneRepository.ts`
   - Map new database columns
   - Implement dual-write strategy (write to old and new columns)

6. **Phase 6:** Update timeline components
   - `src/components/timeline/TimelineBar.tsx`
   - Use `TimelineOrchestrator.getTimelineData()` instead of multiple sources

**Important:**
- Database migration is complete ‚úÖ
- New columns exist: `time_allocation_hours`, `start_date`, `is_recurring`, `recurring_config`
- Use dual-write strategy (write to both old and new columns for backward compatibility)
- All code examples and implementation details are in `LOVABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Testing:**
After implementation, verify:
- Timeline rectangles appear for projects
- Weeks view = Days view (same data)
- Tooltips show correct hours
- No console errors

**Estimated time:** 7-8 hours

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any phase.

Thank you!

Hi Lovable,

Database migration complete ‚úÖ. Ready to implement timeline refactor.

**Please implement Phases 1-6 from `LOVABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

This file contains:
- Complete code examples for each phase
- Files to create/modify
- Backward compatibility strategy
- Testing checklist

Key files to implement:
1. Update `src/types/core.ts` (add RecurringConfig, DayEstimate, update Milestone)
2. Create `src/services/calculations/dayEstimateCalculations.ts` (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
3. Create `src/services/unified/UnifiedDayEstimateService.ts`
4. Create `src/services/orchestrators/TimelineOrchestrator.ts`
5. Update `src/services/repositories/MilestoneRepository.ts` (map new columns)
6. Update `src/components/timeline/TimelineBar.tsx` (use TimelineOrchestrator)

**Goal:** Fix timeline rendering bugs by establishing single source of truth for day estimates.

All details in `LOVABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Questions welcome!

## What to Expect from Lovable:

Lovable will likely:
1. ‚úÖ Read the implementation instructions
2. ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. ‚úÖ Implement phases one by one
4. ‚úÖ Report progress and any issues
5. ‚úÖ May ask for testing/verification

If Lovable asks questions, refer them to:
- `LOVABLE_IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for HOW
- `IMPLEMENTATION_READY.md` for WHAT
- `TIMELINE_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR.md` for WHY

---

## Tips:

**If Lovable asks "Should I proceed?":**
Say: "Yes, please proceed with all 6 phases in order."

**If Lovable encounters errors:**
Ask: "Can you share the error message and which phase you're on?"

**If Lovable asks about testing:**
Say: "Please implement all phases first, then we'll test together."

**If Lovable asks about WeeksView:**
Say: "If WeeksView exists, apply the same pattern as TimelineBar. If it doesn't exist or looks different, let me know and we'll adjust."

---

## After Lovable Completes:

1. I'll review the implementation
2. We'll test the timeline rendering
3. We'll verify weeks view = days view
4. We'll monitor for any errors
5. After 48 hours of stable operation, we can clean up old code

Good luck! The instructions are comprehensive and Lovable should have everything needed. üöÄ
