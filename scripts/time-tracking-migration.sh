# This script tests the new time tracking architecture

echo "ðŸš€ Testing Time Tracking Service Migration"
echo "==========================================="

echo "âœ… Step 1: Removed duplicate timeTrackingSync.ts"
echo "âœ… Step 2: Created new architecture:"
echo "   - Unified Service: /src/services/unified/timeTrackingService.ts"
echo "   - Orchestrator: /src/services/orchestrators/timeTrackingOrchestrator.ts" 
echo "   - Repository: /src/services/repositories/timeTrackingRepository.ts"
echo "   - Validator: /src/services/validators/timeTrackingValidator.ts"
echo "   - Calculations: /src/services/calculations/timeTrackingCalculations.ts"
echo "   - Types: /src/types/timeTracking.ts"

echo "âœ… Step 3: Updated imports in:"
echo "   - /src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx"
echo "   - /src/components/work-hours/TimeTracker.tsx"

echo "ðŸ“‹ MIGRATION SUMMARY:"
echo "====================="
echo "âœ… Eliminated duplication - removed unused timeTrackingSync.ts"
echo "âœ… Restructured into proper architecture layers:"
echo "   â€¢ Unified Service - Main API interface"
echo "   â€¢ Orchestrator - Coordinates business logic and cross-window sync"
echo "   â€¢ Repository - Database operations and localStorage caching" 
echo "   â€¢ Validator - Business rules and state validation"
echo "   â€¢ Calculations - Time calculations and formatting"
echo "âœ… Maintained backward compatibility with existing components"
echo "âœ… Updated all import references"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "=============="
echo "1. Test the application to ensure time tracking still works"
echo "2. Remove the backup file once confident in the migration"
echo "3. Consider updating components to use the new structured API"
