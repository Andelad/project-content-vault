- should groups be a single set? Should I allow multi-set creation
- allow projects with undefined group
- auto-estimate and planned/completed time don't exist on same day. Should that change?
- archive projects or groups? What if a group becomes a past consideration, like finishing university? How does that affect the timeline?
- can a planned and completed calendar event be represented on the timeline onthe same day?
- how far back does the timeline show? Allow archived groups - means timeline isn't a complete historic record. Allow to show archived groups in timeline?
- unallocated events on calendar? Where does their time show? Reduced availability? Extra project row?
- what if someone changes a phase recurrence pattern in the middle of a project? Say they move it to start on a monday from a Wednesday? What happens.
