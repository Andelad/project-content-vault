# Development Guidelines## General Rules- **Use responsive layouts**: Opt for flexbox and grid over absolute positioning- **Keep components small**: Break down large components into smaller, focused ones- **Refactor as you go**: Keep code clean and maintainable- **Single responsibility**: Each function/component should have one clear purpose## Code Organization- **Services first**: All calculations and business logic go in `/src/services/`- **Context boundaries**: Use specialized contexts, avoid god objects- **Import from barrels**: Use `@/services`, `@/constants`, etc. instead of deep imports- **Type safety**: Leverage TypeScript fully, avoid `any`## UI/UX Standards- **Consistent spacing**: Use Tailwind spacing scale consistently- **Color system**: Use OKLCH colors from `/src/constants/colors.ts`- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation- **Loading states**: Always provide feedback for async operations## Performance Guidelines- **Memoize expensive calculations**: Use service layer memoization- **Optimize re-renders**: Use React.memo and useMemo appropriately  - **Lazy load**: Code-split large features- **Cache effectively**: Let CalculationCacheService handle caching## Architecture Principles1. **Separation of concerns**: Components render, services calculate, contexts manage state2. **Single source of truth**: No duplicate logic or data3. **Predictable data flow**: Clear data dependencies and transformations4. **Testable code**: Services should be unit testable in isolation---*These guidelines support the architecture defined in `/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURAL_RULES.md`*
