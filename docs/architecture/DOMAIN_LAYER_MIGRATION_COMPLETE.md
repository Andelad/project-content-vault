## 🎨 Architecture Before & After

### Before: Scattered Logic 😞
```
Components
  └─> Direct business logic (validation, budget checks)
  └─> Legacy entity calls
  └─> Duplicated validation rules

Services  
  └─> Duplicate helper classes
  └─> Embedded business rules
  └─> Inconsistent validation

Result: 15+ files with duplicated business logic
```

### After: Layered Architecture 🎉
```
Components
  └─> UI rendering & user interaction
  └─> Delegates to Orchestrators

Orchestrators
  └─> Workflow coordination
  └─> Delegates to Domain Rules

Validators
  └─> Complex validation coordination
  └─> Delegates to Domain Rules

Domain Rules (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
  └─> ProjectRules
  └─> MilestoneRules
  └─> RelationshipRules

Result: All business logic in 3 files, zero duplication
```

## 💡 Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
```typescript
// BAD: Business logic in component
if (estimatedHours <= 0) {
  errors.push('Hours must be positive');
}

// GOOD: Delegate to domain rules
const validation = ProjectRules.validateEstimatedHours(estimatedHours);
errors.push(...validation.errors);
```

### 2. **Domain Rule Structure**
```typescript
// Domain Rule Pattern
export class ProjectRules {
  /**
   * RULE 1: Project estimated hours must be positive
   * Reference: Business Logic Rule 4
   */
  static validateEstimatedHours(hours: number): boolean {
    return hours > 0;
  }
}
```

### 3. **Validation Coordination**
```typescript
// Validator Pattern: Coordinate, don't duplicate
export class ProjectValidator {
  static validateProject(request) {
    // Delegate to domain rules
    const timeValidation = ProjectRules.validateProjectTime(...);
    const dateValidation = ProjectRules.validateProjectDates(...);
    
    // Add external checks
    const conflicts = this.checkExternalConflicts(...);
    
    return { ...timeValidation, ...dateValidation, conflicts };
  }
}
```

### 4. **Component Delegation**
```typescript
// Component Pattern: Use orchestrators
const wouldExceedBudget = (id, amount) => {
  const budgetCheck = MilestoneRules.checkBudgetConstraint(
    updatedMilestones,
    projectBudget
  );
  return !budgetCheck.isValid;
};
```
