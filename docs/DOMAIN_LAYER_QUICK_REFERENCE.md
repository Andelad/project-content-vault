# Domain Layer Project - Quick Reference

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Ready for Phase 2 Implementation 🚀  
**Date**: October 18, 2025  

---

## What We Created

### 1. Business Logic Reference ✅
**Location**: `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC_REFERENCE.md`  
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for ALL business rules, relationships, and constraints

**Contains**:
- Complete domain model (Users → Groups → Rows → Projects → Milestones)
- All business rules with formulas (10+ major rules documented)
- Entity relationships and constraints
- Invariants (conditions that must always be true)
- Validation rules for all entities
- Calculation rules and formulas
- State transitions
- Edge cases and how to handle them

**Use When**:
- Making any changes to projects/milestones
- Adding validation
- Debugging business logic issues
- Onboarding new developers
- Planning features

---

### 2. Business Logic Audit ✅
**Location**: `docs/architecture/BUSINESS_LOGIC_AUDIT.md`  
**Purpose**: Map of where business logic currently lives and what needs to change

**Contains**:
- Analysis of current architecture (5 fragmented layers)
- Location of business rules in codebase
- Duplication analysis (same rule in 3-5 places!)
- Gap identification
- Proposed domain layer structure
- Migration strategy
- Code examples

**Key Findings**:
- ❌ No single source of truth
- ❌ Rules duplicated across types, services, validators, contexts, components
- ❌ Validation inconsistently applied
- ❌ Client should be an entity (currently just a text field)
- ✅ Some consolidation exists (UnifiedProjectEntity)
- ✅ Good validator layer (but duplicates rules)

---

### 3. Architecture Guide Updates ✅
**Location**: `Architecture Guide.md`  
**Purpose**: Updated to include domain layer as foundational architecture

**Changes**:
- Added domain layer to directory structure
- Updated logic flow diagram (Components → Services → **Domain Layer** → Validators/Calculations)
- Added AI decision matrix for business rules
- New section: "Domain Layer - Business Logic Single Source of Truth"
- Integration patterns documented
- Migration strategy included

---

### 4. Implementation Roadmap ✅
**Location**: `docs/architecture/DOMAIN_LAYER_ROADMAP.md`  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step plan to implement domain layer

**Phases**:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Documentation (Complete)
- 🔄 **Phase 2**: Create domain structure (2 weeks)
- 🔜 **Phase 3**: Migrate validators (2 weeks)
- 🔜 **Phase 4**: Integrate services (2 weeks)
- 🔜 **Phase 5**: Clean up contexts (1 week)
- 🔜 **Phase 6**: Training & documentation (ongoing)

**Total Timeline**: 6-8 weeks  
**Risk Level**: Low (incremental, non-breaking)

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current State 😞
```
Business Logic is scattered:
├── types/core.ts (structure only, no rules)
├── services/unified/ (some rules in UnifiedProjectEntity)
├── validators/ (comprehensive but duplicates rules)
├── contexts/ (mixed with state management)
└── components/ (some validation in UI)

Result: Same rule exists in 3-5 places!
```

**Example**: "Milestone allocation ≤ project budget" appears in:
1. UnifiedProjectEntity.analyzeBudget()
2. UnifiedProjectEntity.wouldExceedBudget()
3. MilestoneValidator.validateMilestoneCreation()
4. UnifiedMilestoneService.validateBudgetAllocation()
5. Various component checks

---

### Future State 🎯
```
Business Logic centralized:
src/domain/
├── rules/ (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
│   ├── ProjectRules.ts (all project rules)
│   ├── MilestoneRules.ts (all milestone rules)
│   └── RelationshipRules.ts (cross-entity rules)
├── entities/
│   ├── Project.ts (domain entity with methods)
│   └── Milestone.ts
└── value-objects/
    ├── TimeAllocation.ts
    └── DateRange.ts

All other layers delegate to domain layer.
```

**Example**: "Milestone allocation ≤ project budget" exists in:
1. domain/rules/MilestoneRules.validateBudget() (ONLY PLACE)
2. Everything else calls this method

---

## Key Benefits

### For Developers
✅ **Single place to check** for business rules  
✅ **Faster debugging** - one place to fix bugs  
✅ **Easier onboarding** - clear documentation  
✅ **Predictable changes** - update in one place  
✅ **Better code completion** - IDE knows the rules  

### For the Codebase
✅ **30-40% code reduction** from deduplication  
✅ **Consistent validation** - rules always applied  
✅ **Easier testing** - domain logic isolated  
✅ **Better reliability** - can't bypass validation  
✅ **Clearer architecture** - separation of concerns  

### For the Product
✅ **Fewer bugs** - consistent rule application  
✅ **Faster development** - no hunting for rules  
✅ **Better quality** - validation always works  
✅ **Easier maintenance** - one place to update

## What's Next: Phase 2

### Create Domain Folder Structure
```bash
mkdir -p src/domain/entities
mkdir -p src/domain/rules
mkdir -p src/domain/value-objects
```

### Extract Business Rules
1. **ProjectRules** from `UnifiedProjectService.ts` (lines 330-550)
2. **MilestoneRules** from scattered validators/services
3. **RelationshipRules** - new consolidation of cross-entity rules

### Maintain Backward Compatibility
- Old code continues to work
- Create delegation wrappers
- No breaking changes
- Gradual migration

### Estimated Time
**2 weeks** for Phase 2 (domain structure creation)

## Common Business Rules (Quick Lookup)

### Project Rules
- ✅ Estimated hours must be > 0
- ✅ End date must be after start date (non-continuous)
- ✅ Must belong to valid Row and Group
- ✅ Continuous projects have no end date

### Milestone Rules
- ✅ Must belong to valid project
- ✅ End date must be within project date range
- ✅ Time allocation must be > 0
- ✅ Sum of allocations ≤ project estimated hours

### Relationship Rules
- ✅ Project → Row → Group (hierarchy)
- ✅ Project → Milestones (1:N)
- ✅ Milestone dates constrained by project dates
- ✅ Milestone allocations constrained by project budget

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Does this involve significant refactoring?
**A**: No, it's incremental. Each phase is independent and non-breaking.

### Q: Will this break existing features?
**A**: No, we maintain backward compatibility via delegation wrappers.

### Q: Why wasn't this done before?
**A**: Common in rapid development - focus on features first, consolidate later.

### Q: How long will it take?
**A**: 6-8 weeks total, but benefits start after Phase 2 (week 3).

### Q: What if we need to roll back?
**A**: Each phase can be rolled back independently with minimal risk.

### Q: How does this affect AI development?
**A**: AI now has a single reference document to consult for all business rules.

## Decision: Go / No-Go

**Recommendation**: ✅ **GO**

**Reasons**:
1. Low risk (incremental, non-breaking)
2. High value (30-40% code reduction, better quality)
3. Foundation complete (documentation ready)
4. Team benefit (easier development, fewer bugs)
5. Product benefit (more reliable, faster features)

**Next Action**: Approve Phase 2 kickoff
