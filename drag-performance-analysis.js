üîç DRAG PERFORMANCE ISSUES ANALYSIS
===================================

IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS:

1. HEAVY DATABASE OPERATIONS DURING DRAG
   - Every mouse move triggers updateProject() and updateMilestone() calls
   - Database round-trips causing 2+ second delays
   - Promise.all() waiting for all DB operations to complete

2. THROTTLED PERFORMANCE MAKES IT WORSE
   - 150ms throttle in weeks mode, 75ms in days mode
   - User drags ‚Üí Wait 150ms ‚Üí Heavy DB operations ‚Üí More delay

3. MILESTONES UPDATE SEPARATELY FROM PROJECT BAR  
   - Milestones only get immediate visual updates for action === 'move'
   - Missing immediate response for 'resize-start-date' action
   - Result: Start date drags cause milestone stutter-stepping

4. COMPLEX MILESTONE CONSTRAINT LOGIC
   - Heavy calculation during every mouse move
   - Filter milestones, find dates, date clamping, validation
   - Unnecessary CPU work during drag

SOLUTIONS:

‚úÖ Separate Visual and Persistence Updates
‚úÖ Fix Milestone Immediate Response for ALL Actions  
‚úÖ Pre-calculate Milestone Constraints
‚úÖ Optimize Mouse Move Handler Performance

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Responsiveness: 2+ seconds ‚Üí <16ms immediate visual response
- Database Load: Multiple DB writes per move ‚Üí One per 300ms max
- CPU Usage: Heavy calculations ‚Üí Lightweight updates
- UX: Laggy inconsistent ‚Üí Smooth synchronized movement
