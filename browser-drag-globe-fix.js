🌐 BROWSER DRAG-AND-DROP GLOBE FIX
==================================

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

Issue: Globe/drag indicator appears when trying to drag timeline elements
Cause: Browser interprets drag actions as native drag-and-drop operations
Result: Broken resize functionality, confusing UX

Root Causes:
❌ Missing e.preventDefault() in drag handlers
❌ Missing draggable={false} on drag elements  
❌ Browser thinks elements are draggable images/links

✅ COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. EVENT PREVENTION:
   Added e.preventDefault() to ALL drag handlers:
   ✅ TimelineView handleMouseDown()
   ✅ TimelineView handleMouseMove() 
   ✅ Holiday handleMouseDown()
   ✅ Holiday handleMouseMove()
   ✅ TimelineBar start circle onMouseDown()
   ✅ TimelineBar baseline onMouseDown()
   ✅ TimelineBar end triangle onMouseDown()

2. DRAG ATTRIBUTE BLOCKING:
   Added draggable={false} to ALL drag elements:
   ✅ Project baseline line
   ✅ Start date circle
   ✅ End date triangle

3. EVENT FLOW CONTROL:
   Maintained e.stopPropagation() to prevent event bubbling
   Added proper event prevention without breaking functionality

🧪 TEST VERIFICATION:

Before Fix:
❌ Globe symbol appears with certain drag angles/pressures
❌ Resize functionality breaks when globe appears
❌ Confusing user experience with mixed drag behaviors

After Fix:
✅ No globe symbol regardless of drag angle/pressure
✅ Clean custom drag behavior only
✅ Consistent resize functionality
✅ No browser interference with timeline interactions

Test Steps:
1. Create project with milestones
2. Try dragging start date circle at various angles
3. Apply different pressures with pen/tablet
4. Drag quickly and slowly
5. Expected: No globe symbol, smooth resize only

🎯 TECHNICAL BENEFITS:

✅ Eliminated browser drag interference
✅ Consistent custom drag behavior
✅ Better pen/tablet compatibility
✅ Cleaner user experience
✅ No more "broken" drag states

The timeline now has clean, custom drag behavior with no browser
drag-and-drop interference or confusing globe indicators.
