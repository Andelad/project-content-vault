## 📋 Current Architecture Status & Technical Debt

### Repository Pattern Inconsistency
**Issue**: Two different repository implementation patterns coexist in the codebase.

**Complex Pattern** (Phase 5A-5B, pre-AI Development Rules):
- `GroupRepository` → extends `UnifiedRepository` → implements `IBaseRepository`
- `ProjectRepository` → extends `UnifiedRepository` → implements `IBaseRepository`
- Features: Advanced caching, offline operations, complex inheritance hierarchy
- Lines: ~900+ lines of complex infrastructure code

**Simple Pattern** (Phase 5C-5E, following AI Development Rules):
- `MilestoneRepository`, `WorkHourRepository`, `CalendarEventRepository` → standalone classes
- Features: Essential CRUD operations, clean separation of concerns
- Lines: ~160-190 lines each, no inheritance complexity

**Impact**: 
- Both patterns work correctly and compilation is clean
- No functional issues or breaking changes
- Architectural inconsistency creates cognitive overhead for developers
- Mixed complexity levels across similar repository implementations

**Recommendation for Future Phase**:
Consider migrating `GroupRepository` and `ProjectRepository` to simple pattern to achieve architectural consistency. This would:
- Reduce overall codebase complexity by ~700+ lines
- Eliminate inheritance hierarchies and complex interfaces
- Standardize on proven simple repository pattern
- Maintain all existing functionality while improving maintainability

**Priority**: Low (after high-value orchestrator integrations complete)
