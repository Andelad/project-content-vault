🖊️ PEN/TABLET DRAG FIX VERIFICATION
===================================

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

Issue: Drag continued after pen lift-off, requiring additional click to stop
Root Cause: Pen/tablet devices use different event types than mouse

Original Event Handling:
❌ mousemove, mouseup only
❌ Missing pointer events (pen/stylus)
❌ Missing touch cancel events
❌ Incomplete cleanup

✅ NEW COMPREHENSIVE EVENT HANDLING:

Added Support For:
✅ mousemove, mouseup (traditional mouse)
✅ pointermove, pointerup (pen/stylus) 
✅ pointercancel (critical for pen lift-off detection)
✅ touchmove, touchend (touch screens)
✅ touchcancel (touch interruption)

Event Flow for Pen/Tablet:
1. Pen touches surface → pointerdown (handled by existing mousedown)
2. Pen moves → pointermove (now handled)
3. Pen lifts off → pointerup OR pointercancel (now both handled)
4. All event listeners removed immediately

🧪 TEST VERIFICATION:

For Pen/Tablet Users:
1. Create project with milestones
2. Switch to weeks view
3. Use pen to drag start date circle
4. Lift pen off tablet surface
5. Move pen around (should NOT affect project)
6. Expected: Drag stops immediately when pen lifts

Debug Console Output:
- During drag: "🎯 DRAG DEBUG" messages
- When pen lifts: "🛑 PROJECT DRAG END - All events cleaned up"

For Mouse Users:
- Should work exactly the same as before
- No performance impact or behavior changes

🎯 TECHNICAL BENEFITS:

✅ Immediate drag termination on pen lift
✅ No ghost dragging or stuck states
✅ Works across all input devices
✅ Robust event cleanup prevents memory leaks
✅ Better user experience for tablet users

The drag system now properly detects pen lift-off and stops immediately,
eliminating the need for additional clicks to end drag operations.
