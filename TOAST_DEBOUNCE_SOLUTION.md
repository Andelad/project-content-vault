# Toast Debouncing Solution

## Problem Fixed
Previously, when dragging projects or holidays across multiple days in the timeline, each incremental move would trigger a success toast notification. This resulted in a flood of "Project updated successfully" or "Holiday updated successfully" toasts, making the UI feel spammy and cluttered.

## Solution Implemented
Added debouncing logic to the `updateProject` and `updateHoliday` functions in:
- `/src/hooks/useProjects.ts`
- `/src/hooks/useHolidays.ts`

### How it works:
1. **Debounce Timer**: Each update call starts a 500ms timer before showing the success toast
2. **Reset on New Updates**: If another update happens within 500ms, the previous timer is cancelled and a new one starts
3. **Single Final Toast**: Only when the dragging stops (no updates for 500ms) does the success toast appear
4. **Immediate Error Toasts**: Error toasts still appear immediately for better UX
5. **Cleanup**: Timers are properly cleaned up on component unmount

### Benefits:
- ✅ No more toast spam during drag operations
- ✅ Single success toast appears after drag operation completes
- ✅ Error toasts still show immediately
- ✅ Smooth, non-intrusive user experience
- ✅ Memory leak prevention with proper cleanup

### Code Changes:
- Added `useRef` for timeout and last updated item tracking
- Modified update functions to use debounced toast logic
- Added cleanup in useEffect for component unmount

### Testing:
Try dragging a project or holiday across multiple days - you should now see only one success toast at the end instead of multiple toasts during the drag operation.
