🎯 PROJECT DRAG BEHAVIOR FIXES VERIFICATION
==========================================

✅ FIXED ISSUES:

1. MIXED DRAG BEHAVIOR - RESOLVED:
   - Start date drag now ONLY moves start date
   - No longer tries to move milestones or end date simultaneously
   - Start date cannot cross or land on milestone/end date

2. END DATE DRAG - IMPROVED:
   - End date drag now ONLY moves end date
   - Cannot cross or land on milestone/start date
   - More precise constraint checking

3. MILESTONE DRAG - ENHANCED:
   - Milestones can only move within their allowed range
   - Cannot cross other milestones, start date, or end date
   - Cannot land on same day as other elements

4. BASELINE DRAG - MAINTAINED:
   - Dragging baseline moves entire project as one unit
   - All milestones maintain their relative positions
   - Even spacing preserved during move

🧪 NEW BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:

┌────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│ DRAG TARGET    │ START DATE  │ END DATE     │ MILESTONES   │ BASELINE    │
├────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Start Circle   │ ✅ Moves    │ ❌ Fixed     │ ❌ Fixed     │ ❌ Fixed    │
│ End Triangle   │ ❌ Fixed    │ ✅ Moves     │ ❌ Fixed     │ ❌ Fixed    │
│ Milestone      │ ❌ Fixed    │ ❌ Fixed     │ ✅ Moves     │ ❌ Fixed    │
│ Baseline Bar   │ ✅ Moves    │ ✅ Moves     │ ✅ Moves     │ ✅ Moves    │
└────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘

🔒 CONSTRAINT RULES:

1. Start Date Constraints:
   - Cannot cross first milestone date
   - Cannot cross end date
   - Cannot be on same day as milestone or end date

2. End Date Constraints:
   - Cannot cross last milestone date
   - Cannot cross start date
   - Cannot be on same day as milestone or start date

3. Milestone Constraints:
   - Cannot cross other milestones
   - Cannot cross start or end date
   - Cannot be on same day as any other element
   - Must stay within project boundaries (start+1 to end-1)

4. Baseline (Move All) Constraints:
   - No constraints - moves everything together
   - Maintains relative spacing between all elements

🧪 MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Create a project with start date, 2-3 milestones, and end date
2. Test Start Date Drag:
   - Drag start circle → only start date should move
   - Try to drag past first milestone → should stop
   - Try to drag to same day as milestone → should stop 1 day before

3. Test End Date Drag:
   - Drag end triangle → only end date should move
   - Try to drag past last milestone → should stop
   - Try to drag to same day as milestone → should stop 1 day after

4. Test Milestone Drag:
   - Drag milestone → only that milestone should move
   - Try to drag past other milestones → should stop appropriately
   - Try to drag to start/end date → should stop 1 day away

5. Test Baseline Drag:
   - Drag project bar background → everything moves together
   - All spacing between elements should be maintained
   - Smooth synchronized movement

✅ EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Clean, predictable drag behavior
- No mixed behaviors or conflicts
- Clear visual feedback for each drag type
- Proper constraint enforcement
- Smooth, responsive interactions

The drag system now provides clear, separate behaviors for each element type
while maintaining proper constraints and user expectations.
