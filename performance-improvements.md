# Timeline Performance Improvements

## Issue Identified
The day view of the timeline was experiencing significant performance degradation, taking several seconds to load when switching from weeks to days mode.

## Root Cause Analysis
The performance bottleneck was caused by multiple expensive calculations happening on every render:

### 1. **Quadratic Time Complexity in Multiple Components**
- `getProjectTimeAllocation` function: O(P × D × H × W) complexity
- `AvailabilityCircles` component: Similar expensive loops for each project and day
- Multiple components calling these functions simultaneously

### 2. **Inefficient Cache Key Generation**
- Cache keys included expensive `JSON.stringify(settings.weeklyWorkHours)`
- Event arrays were included in cache keys, invalidating cache frequently
- Large object serialization was happening on every function call

### 3. **Too Many Days Rendered**
- Day mode was rendering up to 120 days with 15-day buffer
- Each day × project combination triggered expensive calculations

### 4. **Multiple Component Instances**
- 2 AvailabilityCircles + 3 NewAvailabilityCircles = 5 components
- Each doing expensive calculations independently

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Memoized Working Days Calculation**
```typescript
export const memoizedProjectWorkingDays = memoizeExpensiveCalculation(
  (projectStart: Date, projectEnd: Date, settings: any, holidays: any[]) => {
    // Expensive calculation moved to memoized function
  },
  timelineCalculationCache
)
```

### 2. **Memoized Project Time Allocation**
```typescript
export const memoizedGetProjectTimeAllocation = memoizeExpensiveCalculation(
  getProjectTimeAllocation,
  timelineCalculationCache
)
```

### 3. **Optimized Cache Key Generation**
- Replaced `JSON.stringify` with simple hash generation
- Removed event dependency from cache keys
- Focused on essential parameters only
- **Before**: `JSON.stringify(settings.weeklyWorkHours)`
- **After**: Simple sum-based hash

### 4. **Reduced Day Viewport**
- **Before**: Up to 120 days + 15 buffer = 135 days
- **After**: Up to 60 days + 7 buffer = 67 days maximum
- ~50% reduction in rendered days

### 5. **Optimized AvailabilityCircles Component**
- Added `useMemo` for project hours calculation
- Uses `memoizedProjectWorkingDays` instead of expensive loops
- Eliminated redundant working days calculations

### 6. **Enhanced Cache Configuration**
- **Before**: 50 items, 10s TTL
- **After**: 500 items, 30s TTL
- 10x larger cache with longer retention

### 7. **Added Performance Monitoring**
- Function call counters
- Cache hit rate tracking
- Slow operation detection
- Debug logging for viewport calculations

## Performance Impact
- **Expected**: 60-80% reduction in day view load time
- **Cache efficiency**: Dramatically improved hit rates
- **Memory usage**: Controlled via larger but time-limited cache
- **Rendering**: ~50% fewer day columns rendered

## Cache Configuration
- `timelineCalculationCache`: 500 items, 30 second TTL
- `projectMetricsCache`: 300 items, 30 second TTL
- `dateCalculationCache`: 200 items, 30 second TTL

## Debug Information
The application now logs:
- Timeline performance metrics
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Function call counts
- Slow operations (>1ms)
- Viewport day calculations

## Testing Instructions
1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to timeline view
3. Switch from Weeks to Days mode
4. Observe console logs:
   - `🚀 Timeline performance:` shows days/projects/calculations
   - `📊 getProjectTimeAllocation called X times`
   - `📈 Cache stats` shows hit rates
   - `⚠️ Slow getProjectTimeAllocation` for bottlenecks

## Future Considerations
- Virtual scrolling for very large datasets
- Web Workers for heavy calculations
- React concurrent features for better UX
- Further cache optimization based on usage patterns
